        About the band early years
      </h2>

      <p>
        The Red Hot Chili Peppers, commonly abbreviated as RHCP, are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1982,
        comprising vocalist Anthony Kiedis, bassist Flea, drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist John Frusciante.
        Their music incorporates elements of alternative rock, funk, punk rock, hard rock, hip hop, and psychedelic rock.
        Their eclectic range has influenced genres such as funk metal, rap metal, rap rock, and nu metal.
      </p>

        The Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in Los Angeles by Kiedis, Flea, guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons.
        Due to commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's 1984 self-titled debut album,
        which instead featured guitarist Jack Sherman and drummer Cliff Martinez. Slovak rejoined for their second album, Freaky Styley (1985),
        and Irons for their third, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987). Irons left after Slovak died of a drug overdose in June 1988.

        With new recruits Frusciante and Smith, the Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded Mother's Milk (1989) and their first major commercial success,
        Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991). Frusciante was uncomfortable with their newfound popularity and left abruptly on tour in 1992.
        After a series of temporary guitarists, he was replaced by Dave Navarro, who appeared on the group's sixth album, One Hot Minute (1995).
        Although successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of Blood Sugar Sex Magik.

        In 1998, following Navarro's departure, Frusciante rejoined the band. Their seventh album, Californication (1999), 
        became their biggest commercial success, with 16 million copies sold worldwide. 
        By the Way (2002) and Stadium Arcadium (2006) were also successful; 
        Stadium Arcadium was their first album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 chart.

      <blockquote>
        “I've wanted to feel pleasure to the point of insanity. They call it getting high, because it's wanting to know that higher level, 
        that godlike level. You want to touch the heavens, 
        you want to feel glory and euphoria, but the trick is it takes work. You can't buy it, 
        you can't get it on a street corner, you can't steal it or inject it or shove it up your ass, you have to earn it.”

        Curiosities about the band
      </h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Performing as Tony Flow and the Majestic Masters of Mayhem, 
          an early version of the Peppers played their first show made up of improvisational music and frontman Kiedis reading a poem called 'Out in L.A.'
        </li>
        <li>
          During their rocky formative years, Anthony Kiedis and Flea had a hard time keeping permanent members. 
          One of their drummers was Cliff Martinez, 
          who'd go on to compose the soundtracks to movies like 'Drive.'
        </li>
        <li>
          Almost half of the budget for their third album was reserved for drugs.
